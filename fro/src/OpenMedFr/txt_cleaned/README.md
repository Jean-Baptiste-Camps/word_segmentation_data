The categories WebAuthor and WebReuiewer in the metadata attempt to assign credit for the uarious tasks of the proiect. We use the [CASRAI Credit Typology](http//dictionary.casrai.org/Contributor_Roles) here. WebAuthor most closely maps to Data Curation and Web Reuiewer to Writing – Reuiew & Editing.
